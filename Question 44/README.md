## Question 44

The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms increases by 3330,
is unusual in two ways:

(i) each of the three terms are prime, and,

(ii) each of the 4-digit
numbers are permutations of one another.

There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes,
exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence.

**What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?**
