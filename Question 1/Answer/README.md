Question 1. The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

Explanation
-In main() a variable named sum initialized as 0 and data type is long.

-A Prime() function is created that takes sum i.e 0 (initially) and returns a sum of all the prime number below 2 million as per question.

-In prime() function a loop is declared that will iterate the value of variable i (intitalized already) and will run till 2 million and inside this loop another loop is intialized that will check if(i%j==0) or not if the condition is true count variable value will be incremented by 1.

-After nested loop breaks (for(long j=1;j<=i;j++)) breaks a condition will be checked i.e if(count==2). if the condition is true the value of i will be added to the variable sum.

-No input is required by the program.

-Iteration will continnue till (i<2000000).

-Program is running succesfully and is written in Code blocks.
