Question 1 : The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.
 Find the sum of all the primes below two million
 
1. Function to check prime numbers
    (We check with square root of no. so that range will be reduced as we are doing it for large no.
    and convert it to int so we don't get floating no.s).
	
2. Initialize sumofprimes to 0.

3. Provide the range of number to iterate through.
    if it is a prime no. add it to sumofprimes.

4. Display sumofprimes.
