The four adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the
greatest product are 9 × 9 × 8 × 9 = 5832.
Find the thirteen adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number
that have the greatest product. What is the value of this product?

1. Read the 1000-digit number in form of string and for now initialize largest_product as 0.

2. Initialize digits to 13 as we are performing it for 13 adjacent digits.

3. Run the loop till 1000 - 13 initialize product to 1 so we can multiply and save the result.

4. Loop through the particular 13 digits of the set. Save result in product.

5. If we get product greater than 0 i.e largest_product. Assign largest_product equals to product.

6. Display the largest_product (greatest product of 13 adjacent digits.)
